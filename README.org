A small library of routines for calculating interesting quantities
useful in Atomic Physics and Ultrafast Optics.

* Build instructions
  The HP42s =raw= files are generated by typing
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    rake
  #+END_SRC
  in a command line near you. Requires [[http://ruby-lang.org][Ruby]] and [[https://www.perl.org][Perl]] to work.

* Routines
  * =LELEV= :: Load [[file:./eVs.txt][first ionization energies]] (in eV) into a matrix
               named =ELEV=. (Data source: [[https://www.nist.gov/pml/atomic-spectra-database][NIST]])
* Caveats
  These routines are only tested using [[http://thomasokken.com/free42/][Free42]], as I don't own a real
  HP42s device.
